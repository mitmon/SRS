Title: Suitability Rating System Version 6
Version: 6.3.0
Author: Mitch Krafczek (AAFC)

Description: The suitability rating system is the 6th iteration of the Agriculture
 and Agri-Foods land suitability rating system (https://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/manuals/1995-lsrs/index.html). 
 The original system was created in response to the number of concerns regarding 
 the Canada Land Inventory (CLI). Namely, the following has been identified:
    - Modifications of the CLI by several agencies had resulted in a variety of
    non-comarable approaches in land capability rating across Canada. 
    - The influence of climate on land suitability for crop production was not 
    adequately taken into account
    - Organic soils were not included
    - Lack of specificity in definitions and application guidelines had led to 
    inconsistent ratings among land rating practitioners.
    The 6th version looks to expand on the previous versions, introducting raster 
    data processing, open source based calculations, front facing client systems,
    and back-end 'on-the-fly' data processing for user specific requirements.
